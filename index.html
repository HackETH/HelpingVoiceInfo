<a id="terms-of-use" class="anchor" href="#terms-of-use" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Terms of Use</h2>

<p>Last updated: July 5, 2015</p>

<p>Please read these Terms of Use (“Terms”) carefully. By downloading, accessing, or using the mobile application Helping Voice you agree to be bound by these Terms. These Terms affect your legal rights and obligations, so if you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Services.</p>

<p>Have Fun</p>

<p>Although these Terms form a proper legal contract—and inevitably read like a proper legal contract—the bulk of them are simply designed to ensure our users have fun. These Terms let us provide and continue to improve our Services, while at the same time ensuring that a few mean users don’t ruin the fun for everyone else. Your part in that is simple. Just use common sense: Keep sending awesome pictures to your chatpartner, and please don’t send pictures that they don’t want to receive.</p>

<p>Our Audience</p>

<p>Helping Voice is intended for people who are at least 13 years old. Persons under the age of 13 are prohibited from creating using Helping Voice.</p>

<p>We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the Services to any person or entity. We may, without notice and in our sole discretion, terminate your right to use the Services, or any portion thereof, and block or prevent your future access to and use of the Services or any portion thereof.</p>

<p>Our Rules</p>

<p>Helping Voice is about sharing moments and having fun. Our goal in creating these rules is to accommodate the broadest range of self expression while balancing the need for our users to be able to use our service safely and enjoyably.</p>

<p>Don’t send people pictures they don’t want to receive—especially if the picture is mean.</p>

<p>Be thoughtful about what you send to your chatpartner. It’s okay with us if someone takes a screenshot, but we can’t speak for you or your Helping Voice Partner. Helping Voice attempts to detect screenshots and notify the sender, but it doesn’t always work perfectly - and your chatpartner can always capture the image with a camera.</p>

<p>Keep it legal. Don’t use Helping Voice for any illegal shenanigans and if you’re under 18 or are matched with someone who might be: keep your clothes on!</p>

<p>What not to send:</p>

<p>Pornography
Nudity or sexually suggestive content involving minors (people under the age of 18)
Minors engaged in activities that are physically dangerous and harmful
Invasions of privacy
Threats
Harassment or Bullying
Impersonation
Self-Harm
Violating these rules may result in the removal of content, the suspension of your account and being prohibited from using Helping Voice in the future.</p>

<p>Blocking &amp; Reporting</p>

<p>If you think that your chatpartner doesn't follow our rules you have the ability to either Block or Report him. When you block your chatpartner you will no longer get any photos from him. When you think that your Helping Voice partner clearly violates our Rules, please report him via the settings section in the app. We will then look into the issue.</p>

<p>Alltough you can use the report feature to get a new match before your 24 hours have ended, we strongly discourage you from doing so if there's no reason to report your chatparter. If we see that you repeatedly report user for no valid reason we will block you temporarly or completely from using our service.</p>
